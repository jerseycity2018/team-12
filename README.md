# The Central Solution
## The Central Park Conservancy Challenge

# CHALLENGE AND SOLUTION

This hack is aimed towards helping the Central Park Conservancy better understand their visitor demographics and visitor experience so as to be able to better tailor to visitor needs.

The main type of visitor data that is focused on within this hack includes:

    - Demographics
    - Activities visitors engage in at Central Park
    - Frequency of visits to Central Park
    - Areas of Central Park that are frequented

# TECHNIQUE

By leveraging web scraping techniques, we were able to create a heatmap of most visited places within Central Park during any given time of the day. 

By utilizing React.js, we were able to create an organized website for the visitors to utilize. 

Through mock data manipulation, were were able to upload information to be used by our hack -- we had wanted to use social media and APIs, such as the Twitter API, but were not able to get access in time. For anyone who will take over this project, that is something to consider because of the data that can be extrapolated from social media accounts using hashtags and locations to provide more data for data analysis.

# FOCUS

There are two main focuses of our hack, which consists of 1) data collection into databases and 2) a website that users can interact with that will increase visitor engagement with the park.

The visitors of the website are able to take a survey regarding who they are, what activities they took part of during their time at the park, if they are New York residents or tourists, and the area of the park that they visited. 

# INCENTIVES

Although we did not get to it in too much depth due to the limited 20 hour scope of this hack, we think an engaging point system could be put into place to encourage registration, visitor revisits, and completion of surveys on the website. Perhaps a hashtag challenge or campaign can be started focusing on park visitors picking up trash, posting a video of him/her doing so, and tagging 3 of his/her friends and challenging them to do the same. Social media accounts could potentially be linked to the user's account on the website and each post for the challenge could be tracked. There could be a point system in place awarding an X amount of points to Y amounts of posts of the user that promote the challenge. Not only would this be virtually uncostly, but it would be a way to get the word out about Central Park and the types of behaviors that the visitors should be encompassing.
